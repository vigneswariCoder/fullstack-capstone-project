**As a** full-stack developer
**I need** to create and manage backend and frontend components for the GiftLink application

**So that** the GiftLink community has a secure, robust, and engaging platform
### Details and Assumptions
    *The backend services must handle authentication, gift management, and community interactions.
    *The frontend must offer a user-friendly interface for managing user accounts, browsing gifts, and 
        participating in the community.
    *The system must be scalable to accommodate growing user traffic.

### Acceptance Criteria
    gherkin
    Given that a user wants to log in to the GiftLink platform  
    When they enter valid credentials  
    Then the system should authenticate them and provide access to the dashboard
